            <!-- Description -->
            <dd>Line-casting allowed type to be selected, used, then recirculated
            into the machine automatically. This advance increased the speed of
            typesetting and printing dramatically.</dd>

            <dt>Photocomposition</dt>
            <dd>Typefaces are stored on film then projected onto photo-sensitive
            paper. Lenses adjust the size of the type.</dd>

            <dt>Digital type</dt>
            <dd>
            <!-- Paragraph within description -->
            <p>Digital typefaces store the outline of the font shape in a
            format such as Postscript. The outline may be scaled to any size for
            output.</p>
            <p>Postscript emerged as a standard due to its support of
            graphics and its early support on the Macintosh computer and Apple
            laser printer.</p>

    <!-- Long quotations -->
    <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his
        profession:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in
        what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
        <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
        down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
        conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in
        the interpretation.</p>
